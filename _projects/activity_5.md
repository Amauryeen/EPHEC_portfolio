March 2023 saw the start of elections for student representatives. I thought “why not?” and put in a application. I was happy to see that I'd been elected. So began my year as a member of the Student Council, as well as secretary and administrator.

I was able to work on various projects such as setting up the CHE2 Discord server, setting up all the IT organization for the ball and the ticket website, and setting up all the logistics for the sweater sales and the website.

It was a memorable experience that taught me a lot.
