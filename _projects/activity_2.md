On March 8, 2024, I was once again able to take part in Belgium's biggest cybersecurity challenge. The aim here was to achieve the same position as the year before, or even better.

I was pleased to see that we finished 60th out of 290 teams, which was respectable considering that this year's difficulty had gone up a notch.
