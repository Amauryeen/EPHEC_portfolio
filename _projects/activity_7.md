Having overseen the Capture The Flag activity the year before, it was time this time to create it. So I set up a complete Capture The Flag with my colleague Thomas. We were able to choose the hosting that would best suit the project. We got to work with Docker, set up a Portainer to easily manage our containers, and also set up the CTFd platform which we configured to suit high school students.
