As React is a very popular library in the IT world, I decided to take a short course on the basics so that I could make use of it in the world of work and in future projects.

It's even more interesting for me to learn the basics knowing that my final year project uses NextJS, a framework based on React.

Thanks to this course, I've been able to learn how components, states, TSX files and more work.
