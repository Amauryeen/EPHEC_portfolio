On March 10, 2023, I was lucky enough to be able to compete in Belgium's biggest cybersecurity challenge. I threw myself into it without knowing much about the field. I was happy and surprised to see that it wasn't that difficult to get through.

In fact, our team finished 59th out of 289 participating teams.

The challenge, which is carried out in teams of 4, consists in completing a series of challenges, all ranging in difficulty from easy to extreme. Each challenge, once completed, earns a certain number of points. The aim is to find a flag hidden in each challenge.
