## about

I'm a 21 years old bachelor student with a passion for computers. My ambition is to make it my vocation and deepen my knowledge in this fascinating field. I'm very comfortable with development, whether in Python or JavaScript in particular. I also have advanced knowledge of HTML, CSS and SQL. Aside from my studies, I'm an avid gamer and cybersecurity enthusiast. My aim is to continue to learn and grow in these fields, and perhaps one day make a significant contribution to the advancement of technology.

Once I complete my graduation, I wish to begin working to gain some experience in the different IT fields. I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity and software development. I'm also considering the possibility of continuing my studies in a master's program, but I'm not yet sure about that. I'm open to any opportunity that will allow me to deepen my knowledge and gain experience in the field of IT.
